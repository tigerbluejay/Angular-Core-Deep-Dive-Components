    <!-- This old syntax ngFor has been replaced by the for directive.
    it has similar features as the new modern for, that is, an index,
    first, last, even and odd, which can be applied to classes defined
    in the stylesheet. cardIndex i+1 is applied so that in the loop
    the index changes for every card.
    Remember we have to define cardIndex in the model (), that is, in the
    course-card.component.ts file. Also to display we have to add courseIndex
    to the view, that is in course-card.html. -->
