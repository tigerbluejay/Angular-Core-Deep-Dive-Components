<!-- EVENTS 
On the button html element, thereÂ´s a native browser event click associated with a method OnCourseViewed()
When the button is clicked, the event is fired as specified in the model.
The onCourseViewed() method fires an emitter which bubbles up a course object.
(defined in the Output section of the model)
The object is intercepted at the parent level on the onCourseSelected method
of the course-card tag.
That method receives the course object and prints it as per the onCourseSelected
method instructions.
